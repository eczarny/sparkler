    <h2>Release Notes Not Found</h2>

    <p>Sparkler was unable to locate any release notes for the selected application. This can happen for a couple of reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is no release notes URL associated with this update.</li>
      <li>There is no description included with this update.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please visit this developer's website for more information on this update.</p>
